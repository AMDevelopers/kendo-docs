# How-To: Create new Documentation

In this how-to, we'll examine how to create a new documentation page for the KendoUI documentation site.

## Introduction

Everything is built using markdown, so it's really easy. You can just commit a new source file to the version control system. This gives great control of version history.

* easily commit new changes to the documentation;
* maintain the previous versions of all documents so nothing is ever lost;
* Open up the documentation so you can accept issues and pull requests from your users;
* create a branch of new updates that can be released to your users all at once;

## New features coming soon

A whole bunch of new features are being worked on by Brendan Enrick and Scott DePouw. Some of these are UX changes, and others include features like having previous versions of the documentation.

Along with these feature requests, we are adjusting the software so that it will work well for other software to use it as documentation.
